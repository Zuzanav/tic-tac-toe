[Play the Tic Tac Toe Game Here!](https://tic-tac-toe-zv.herokuapp.com/)

---

## Description:
This is a Tic Tac Toe game built in React. Upon loading the game, Player 1 can select a square in which they will place their 'X'. 

At the top, the game will let the players know whose turn is next. 

Next, Player 2 can select a square in which they will place their 'O', and so on. 

If either player wins, the winner is displayed at the top and the game will no longer accept further turns.

## Future Features: 
I plan on adding extra bells and whistles to this game by:
- Adding a reset button so one does not need to refresh the page in order to start a new game
- If game reaches a 'draw', change text above that indicates it is a draw
- Additional styling to the "X" and "O" 

## Technologies Used: 
- React 
- Node.js
